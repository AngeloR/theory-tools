# Pedagogical Philosophy

This application is designed from the perspective of an experienced jazz guitar theory teacher.

## Core Teaching Goals

The app should train users to:

1. Think in **scale degrees**, not fretboard shapes
2. Use **correct note spelling** to communicate with non-guitarists
3. Instantly identify the **root** anywhere on the neck
4. Understand that scales exist **across the entire fretboard**
5. Translate between:
   - theoretical language (♭3, 6, 7)
   - physical positions on the guitar

The goal is not memorization, but **functional fluency**.

> If a student can name it correctly and see it everywhere,
> they can play it correctly with the band.

## Anti-Goals (Pedagogically)

This app deliberately avoids:

- CAGED-based teaching
- Box-pattern memorization
- Shape-first learning
- Guitar-only thinking

Patterns should _emerge naturally_ from understanding the whole neck.

# Jazz Fretboard Trainer

This project is a **jazz-theory-driven guitar fretboard trainer** designed to teach musicians how to think, name, and visualize scales correctly in a real ensemble context.

The app prioritizes:

- Proper diatonic spelling
- Scale-degree awareness
- Full-neck visualization
- Communication-ready theory (for playing with piano, bass, and horns)

This is **not** a pattern-memorization or CAGED-based tool.

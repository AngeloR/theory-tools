# Guitar Theory Tools

This project is a **guitar-focused theory toolkit** for visualizing scales, modes, chords, and the circle of fifths on the fretboard. It emphasizes correct spelling and practical context so you can communicate clearly with other musicians and apply theory in real playing situations.

The app prioritizes:

- Proper diatonic spelling
- Scale-degree awareness
- Full-neck visualization
- Clear key, mode, and chord relationships

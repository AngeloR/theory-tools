# Fretboard Model

## Tuning

- Default: standard tuning (E A D G B E)
- Users can customize each string's open note
  - String 6 is the top/highest row; string 1 is the bottom/lowest row

## Layout

- 6 strings
- 24 frets
- No open-string column (fret 0 is not shown)
- High E string rendered at the top

## Rendering Rules

- Notes in the selected scale are rendered with note + degree
- Non-scale frets are blank unless a chord focus is active
- Chord focus (from Circle of Fifths) reveals chord tones across the neck
- Pitch-class identity is mapped back to spelled scale notes

## Inlays

Standard inlay positions:

- Single: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Double: 12
- Single: 15, 17, 19, 21
- Double: 24

Inlays are decorative only.
